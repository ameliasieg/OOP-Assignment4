Data Structures, Algorithms, and Generic Programming I (a.k.a. Object-Oriented Programming)- Programming Assignment 4

For this assignment, I built a class that contains basic information about students and courses that have those students on the roster. I also built a menu that supports basic CRUD functionality for those courses. There is both a Student class and a Course class with the Menu program acting as a driver program that manages a dynamically allocated array of courses and allows the user to perform certain functions.
